# Apple-School-Manager-Import
Python script to automate the creation of upload files for Apple School Manager from Veracross exports.
The script expects five CSV export files from the Veracross school information system, VCstudents.csv VCstaff.csv VCcourses.csv VCclasses.csv VCrosters.csv,  to be in the Downloads folder of a user on a Mac OS computer with the standard drive name of Macintosh HD. The results of the script intended to be in a folder named "uploads" in the same folder where the script files are located. The names of the Veracross export files and the locations of both input files and output files is set in the "main" function of the script and is easily edited if needed by the individual user.
